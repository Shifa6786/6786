        <p style="color:rgb(51, 129, 51)">   Respect means that you accept somebody for who they are, even when they're different from you or you don't agree with them.<br> <br> Respect in your relationships builds feelings of trust, safety, and wellbeing. <br> <br> Respect doesn't have to come naturally â€“ it is something you learn.</p>
